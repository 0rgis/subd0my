# subd0my

Simple python script to scan for sub domains.

I have now included a smallish wordlist to get you started, from here https://github.com/theMiddleBlue/DNSenum/tree/master/wordlist

Any suggestions very welcome.

# Installation
#### Dependencies
You will need python3 & requests module installed to use.

`sudo apt updtae && apt install python3-pip`

`pip3 install requests`

`git clone https://github.com/0rgis/subd0my.git`

`cd subd0my && python3 subd0my.py`

#### Usage

Just follow the on screen prompts & path to wordlist including the .extension if any.
If you have a word list in the same directory as the script then just pass the full name.
Give it time to run your list, output file can have an extension thats upto you & it outputs the results as list.

*If running in windows please use absolute path to word list even if
it is the same directory as the script.*
